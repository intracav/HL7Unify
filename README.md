# HL7Unify ü§ù

### Description:

HL7Unify is an open-source project designed to streamline and unify Electronic Health Record (EHR) data exchange among various hospitals using HL7 standards. This project aims to simplify the interoperability challenges faced by healthcare institutions by providing a common platform for exchanging, storing, and managing EHR data in a standardized and secure manner. HL7Unify includes a FastAPI server setup for efficient data communication and handling.

### Key Features:

- **HL7 Integration**: Seamless integration with HL7 standards for efficient data exchange.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitates interoperability among multiple hospitals and healthcare systems.
- **Data Security**: Ensures data security and compliance with healthcare regulations.
- **FastAPI Server**: Utilizes FastAPI for building fast and modern web APIs with Python.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the growing needs of healthcare organizations.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization to adapt to specific hospital requirements.

### Data Standardization Standards:

HL7Unify incorporates the following standards to ensure efficient data standardization:
- **HL7 v2.x**: Widely used messaging standard for exchanging healthcare information.
- **HL7 v3**: Provides a framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information.
- **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)**: Modern standard for healthcare data exchange, focusing on ease of implementation and interoperability.

### FastAPI Server Setup:

HL7Unify utilizes FastAPI for its server setup, providing the following benefits:
- **Fast**: High-performance web framework for building APIs quickly.
- **Modern**: Takes advantage of Python type hints for automatic data validation.
- **Interactive API Documentation**: Automatically generated interactive API documentation for easy testing and exploration.

### Getting Started:

To get started with HL7Unify, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure the settings according to your hospital's requirements in `config.py`.
4. Start the FastAPI server by running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
